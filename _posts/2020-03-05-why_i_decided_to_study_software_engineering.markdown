Well, I've been on and off programming for about four or five years. I've always found programming fascinating. I started off being a nosey, rebellious kid wanting to learn cybersecurity and flaws in systems. Started finding certain bugs for a private server game I used to play. During then I became much more interested in the software side of things.
A few years down the line I know a decent amount of HTML/CSS/SQL, a ton of Python, a little C#, JavaScript, and Ruby.
I can't wait to see where this Flatiron Journey is going to take me!
