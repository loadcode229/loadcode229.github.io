# What does my Project do?
* You're able to log in as a user.
* You're able to create, view, and edit a user.
* You're able to create multiple jedis and lightsabers.
* You're able to perform basic CRUD operations on jedis/lightsabers.

Considering I struggled through my Mod 1 CLI Project, I knew I wanted to be prepared for my Mod 2 Sinatra Project.

Taking different approaches to learning this Mod has helped greatly. 
I was much more prepared for the creativity side of this project.
Figuring out what I wanted to do, where I wanted which route to go, which actions display which error page, etc.
I was in full control this time and it was a great feeling.

Creating a basic rough draft of the Sinatra Project wasn't as time consuming as I thought, allowing me to focus on polishing a lot more near the end of project weeks.
Personally, I think adding CSS and making finishing touches was the most time consuming and stressful part of this project.
I can't stress how much my limited knowledge in CSS came in handy.

For the Bonus section of the project, adding error pages to your website was pretty easily executed.
Creating a section under my `helpers do` to raise specific 403/404 errors depending on which action was taken.
if you tried to go to a route and you weren't logged in, a fancy webpage would pop up, offering you links to direct you back to the previous page.
These can be displayed using a class name within an .erb file and in your .css file you can design that class name to your liking.
